# edX_Capstone
2 Machine Learning projects done as part of HarvardX: PH125.9x Capstone Course for the Data Science Professional Certificate

The first project is the MovieLens recommendation system. The movielens repository contains 3 files: a project report in .rmd, a project report in .pdf and a .R script with all the code.

The second project is a Choose Your Own project. 

The iris_practice files are for practice only using the iris dataset to practice some of the ML concepts learnt in the edX course.
