# Overview

This project is part of the HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course, the final course for the Data Science Professional Certificate. 

Then the given dataset will be prepared and setup. An exploratory data analysis is carried out in order to develop a machine learning algorithm that could predict movie ratings until a final model. Results will be explained. Finally the report ends with some concluding remarks.


## Introduction

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
